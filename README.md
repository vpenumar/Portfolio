My Data Engineering Journey
Screenshots of my recent project in

Architect, build and launch efficient and reliable data pipelines to move data from API to Google BigQuery (Python, Bash Shell, Postgres)
Design and develop analytics to enable other teams to consume and understand data faster (BigQuery, Aggregated Tables, Tableau)

My Data Visualization Portfolio
Tableau Gallery
A gallery of marketing campaign analysis, customer lifetime value (LTV) for mobile game and Brand CVM (Customer Value Management). The backend is Hadoop/Hive and TreasureData.

My Data Science Portfolio
Multiple Linear Regression
In this HackerRank challenge, a model is to be built to predict house prices using multiple features. Solutions are illustrated with 3 different implementations in

R (using lm() function)
Python (using numpy and sklearn)_
Octave/Matlab (using Normal Equation)

Classification Tree and Random Forest in R
The goal of the project is to predict the manner in which people did the exercise. Two models, Fitting Single Tree and Random Forest, are used and results are cross-validated.

My Data Engineering Portfolio
Stock Market Data ETL and Processing with Pig and HIVE
This repository consist of two modules:

ETL and processing of NYSE_daily and NYSE_dividends data

ETL, Exploratory Data Analysis and Query of stock market indices since 1970. Data is obtained from Yahoo Finance

Kafka Producer and Kafka Consumer in Java
This program illustrates how a Kafka Producer Group sends messages on my_topic, with key = my_key, to Kafka Consumer Group, which consumes messages sent on my_topic.

Data Processing with Spark in Java
This Java program illustrates how to use Spark to process data in HDFS and write the results back to HDFS.

Web server log analysis with Spark
This program illustrates how to use Apache Spark on real-world text-based production logs.

Data Pipeline from Yahoo-Finance to MySQL in Python
This program illustrates how to obtain large volume of historical data from public sources (more than 30 years of financial data) and update a database e.g. MySQL. Similar technique can be used to update other databases e.g. by using Python Driver for Apache Cassandra.

My Genome Data Science Portfolio
DNA Sequencing Algorithms with Approximate Matching: Boyer-Moore, K-Mer Index, Pigeon-Hole.
Generic Naive Approximate Matching allows up to n mismatches

Boyer-Moore Pre-processing with approximate matching

Pigeon Hole with Boyer-Moore or K-Mer Index, and approximate matching

Analyzing DNA sequences in Multi-Fasta Format using Python
A Python program that analyzes a file containing DNA sequences in multi-FASTA format.

DNA Sequencing Analysis: lambda_virus.fa and Human Genome FASTQ file with Python
Analyze lambda virus genome and real DNA sequencing reads derived from a human
Naive exact matching algorithm that is strand-aware, and Naive matching algirithm that allows up to 2 mismatches per occurrence.
